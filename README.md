## Purpose

As a growth analyst at Mercado Libre, with over 200 million users, Mercado Libre is the most popular e-commerce site in Latin America. I've been tasked with analyzing the company's financial and user data in an attempt to help the company grow. So, it is my intent to find out if the ability to predict search traffic can translate into the ability to successfully trade the stock.

This task is divided into four steps, as follows:

Step 1: Find unusual patterns in hourly Google search traffic.

Step 2: Mine the search traffic data for seasonality.

Step 3: Relate the search traffic to stock price patterns.

Step 4: Create a time series model with Prophet.
